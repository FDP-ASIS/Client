# Automatic Software Installation System 
A standard academic final degree project in software engineering. <br />
It was created for "Afeka College (Tel Aviv Academic College of Engineering)" which makes the software installation process in the various 
courses a fully automated, non-contact process.
This documentation is only for the client-side of the project. <br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), 
using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. <br />

It contains also Electron (for creating a desktop app), 
Blueprint (React-based UI toolkit for the web) <br/> 
and TypeScript (open-source programming language developed. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run release`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed! <br />
