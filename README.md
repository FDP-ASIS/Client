**Automatic Software Installation System** is a standard academic final degree project in software engineering. <br />
It was created for "Afeka College (Tel Aviv Academic College of Engineering)" which makes the software installation process in the various 
courses a fully automated, non-contact process.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), 
using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. <br />

It contains also Electron (for creating a desktop app),
